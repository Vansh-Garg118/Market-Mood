# Market-Mood
## Stock Sentiment Analysis using NLP & Deep Learning

## Overview
This project analyzes over 10,000 financial news headlines to predict stock market sentiment using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning. The model achieves an 85% accuracy rate using LSTM networks and various NLP preprocessing techniques.

## Features
- **NLP Preprocessing:** Cleans text by removing stopwords, punctuations, and performing tokenization.
- **Sentiment Classification:** Classifies news headlines into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.
- **Visualization:** Uses Seaborn and WordCloud for data representation.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements an LSTM-based neural network for sentiment prediction.
- **Built with:** TensorFlow, NLTK, Gensim, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Installation
To run the project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas tensorflow nltk gensim seaborn wordcloud matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize the results:
```bash
jupyter notebook "market mood (1).ipynb"
```

## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset of financial news headlines with labeled sentiment.

## Results
- **85% accuracy** achieved using LSTM networks.
- **Clear visual insights** into market sentiment trends.
